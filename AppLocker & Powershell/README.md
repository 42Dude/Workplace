  These 2 powershell scripts are for enabling AppLocker using PowerShell on Windows 10+ Machines :)

    1: Apply the powershell script "Enable-Applocker.ps1" at LOGON for the targetted users and run as SYSTEM
    2: Apply the powershell script "Delete-Applocker-Policies.ps1" at LOGOFF for the targetted users and run as SYSTEM (tip: also run at LOGON for the users not targetted at step 1)
